"""
This file contains four classes which are used as the main interface for 
the user of FATX-on-a-snake. 
Actually, I lied, you are only supposed to interact with three
of them, since FatxObject is the common baseclass from wich the others
extend. My reasoning behind this is, that in FATX you only interact with
"DirectoryEntrys" which are always the same, no matter if they are a file
or a directory. So it makes sense to me that they should share a similar
interface which subclasses extend to implement specific behavior. 
The functions of the classes are described in the README, how ever since 
you are already here, take a look at FatxObject and read the comments on 
the methodes. :)
